The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is designed with the goal of simplifying and automating the administrative processes for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers and their supervisors. Built using the robust .NET Core MVC framework, the system offers a scalable architecture suitable for both small and large institutions. One of its key features is the ability for lecturers to submit their monthly claims through a streamlined and intuitive interface. The claims submission process includes fields for selecting the relevant modules and programs, ensuring proper classification and tracking of work done.
In addition, lecturers can upload any necessary supporting documents directly to the platform, ensuring that all claims are fully backed by documentation, improving accountability and reducing the likelihood of errors. Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers are provided with an organized dashboard that allows them to quickly review and approve claims, with options to provide feedback if necessary. The system offers transparent claim tracking, allowing lecturers to monitor the progress of their submissions in real-time, from submission through verification and final approval.
From a technical perspective, CMCS incorporates a reliable database layer using SQL Server, ensuring that all data is stored securely and efficiently. Entity relationships are properly modeled, with entities such as Module, Programme, Lecturer, and Claim integrated into the database to reflect real-world workflows. The application also supports role-based authentication, ensuring that users only have access to the functionalities they are authorized to use.
The project comes with a comprehensive README file that includes step-by-step instructions for cloning the application, setting up the local development environment, configuring the database, and running the application. Additionally, a detailed User Manual with screenshots helps users understand the various operations, including claim submission, document uploads, verification, and tracking. To facilitate collaboration and version management, the source code and documentation are managed in a public GitHub repository, making it easy for team members and contributors to access and contribute to the project. The system is designed with scalability and future updates in mind, ensuring it can grow and adapt to the evolving needs of the users.
